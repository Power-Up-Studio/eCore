**The future of client-side JavaScript.**  

eCore is a fully open-source library with the goal to use no dependencies and make JavaScript developement faster.  

Anyone can contribute to the developement of eCore and request new features or report bugs, we want to solve all problems, even the small ones, anyone is allowed to contribute and share their ideas, even if its a small issue but slows down developement, we will accept it.  

The first version of eCore is currently in developement and this repository will remain empty and in preparation, the package will be released here, on npm and yarn when finished.  

**Note that eCore will only work in the browser and not in Node.js, a version for Node.js might be released based on the support and success of this project.**
